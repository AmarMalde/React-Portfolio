        <p>Hi! I'm Amar and I'm currently a treasury assistant for a motion picture equipment company. I've
          worked
          in accounts for almost 5 years and whilst I have enjoyed learning about how company's manage their
          accounts, I want to change to a career that stimulates my creativity and passion for
          coding.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this I recently undertook a bootcamp with Trilogy Education. This course will
          teach
          me the fundementals of front-end web development and web design. It emphasis the agile methodology
          and
          programming with peers.
          Front-end web development is cuurently one of the most in demand careers and demand is only going to
          increase, which makes it a fantastic career to switch to.</p>
        <p>So far I have become proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as jQuery, Bootstrap and Git/
          Github.
          I have also self taught myself some Python and Ruby.+</p>
        <p>All Github links for the projects can be found in the bottom section of the page</p>
